        most web pages and online applications. A hypertext is a text that is used to

        </p style="margin-top:45px;">HTML elements are the
        building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
        image and other objects, such as interactive forms, may 
        be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means
        to create structured documents by denoting structural
        semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
        links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are
        delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
